# General information.

The Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) section of the International 
Association for Vegetation Science got funding for an assistantship to work 
on a bibliometric analysis paper. The idea is to analyze the collaboration 
networks based on co-authorships and citations extracted from vegetation 
science journals (JVS, AVS, and VCS) to understand better the importance 
and specificities of our region (LAC) within global collaborations. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kMpyrSqahfCV29O4j4FLLt9FbYCk6LIyRnAzwbfozPk/edit?usp=sharing)
is the proposed project. You may also look at the following conference
