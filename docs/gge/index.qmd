# Introduction


These are preliminary instructions for georeferencing locations manually extracted from publications.
This information can usually be found in the *Materials and methods* or *Study site* sections.

We will use the following publication as an example:

> `r with(Bib, citation[bibtexkey == "Luebert2000"])`

## Install Google Earth

If you have not already done so, you will need to install **Google Earth Pro** on your desktop.
To do this, visit [this link](https://www.google.com/earth/about/versions/#earth-pro).
:::

When you open Google Earth, you will see a left pane that resembles a file browser and is organised into two top-level categories, **My Places** and **Temporary Places**.

# Manual georeferencing workflow

## Organize publications as folders

Right-click on **My Places** and select in the pop-up menu **Add -> Folder**.
This will create a folder with a name of your choice.
In this example we have used the name **georeferenced-papers**.

Now right-click on the new folder and follow the same steps to create a subfolder.
This time name the subfolder with the publication ID, which in our example is **Luebert2000**.
It is very important to avoid mistakes in this step, otherwise the merging of coordinates with the reference entry in the database may fail.

## Insert placemarks for single publications

In our example, the publication contains a map in which a rectangle is highlighted that includes the **Salar de Punta Negra** and the **Parque Nacional Llullaillaco**.
We will therefore place a point in the centre of this rectangle.

To add placemarks, first select the folder for your publication (left-click on the left pane), then go to the menu bar at the top and click on the **Add Placemark** icon: ![](images/add-placemark.png){height=50}

The placemark will appear in the middle of your screen, but you can drag and drop it to the right location.

You can collect several publication localities in your defined folder before exporting to KML and submitting to the database custodian.
Each publication folder can contain more than one placemark (in the case of multiple survey locations).
For comparison, you can look at [this example](../../data-raw/georeferenced-papers.kml).

# Export and submit

When you are finished and would like to submit your progress, you need to select your main folder (in this example **georeferenced-papers**) and **right-click -> Save Place As ...**.
Browse to your destination folder and make sure you select **Files of type: Kml (\*.kml)** (the drop down menu at the bottom of the wizard).

Well done! You can now send the kml file you have created to the database administrator.
